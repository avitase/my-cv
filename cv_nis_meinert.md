**Why this looks like a 1998 README:** I normally prefer to typeset my documents in LaTeX, but many ATS/HR parsers still do their best work on boring, linear text, so this version is intentionally plain Markdown.
Proudly made without: Microsoft Word templates, multi-column layout tricks, icon fonts, "skill bars" or AI.

## Personal Profile
A particle physicist, working as an ML/AI researcher with strong feelings for contemporary C++. He codes in Python when necessary, ponders about SIMD and clean APIs in C++ when possible, and secretly fell in love with APL. Since 2023, he is the team lead of a research team at DLR where they tackle challenging problems such as Multi Object Tracking using X-band marine radar data.

### Team Lead - Frontier Development Lab (remote): Jun 2022 -- Aug 2022
- Leading a team of four researchers to improve the detection and our understanding of Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) clouds.
- Training a machine learning model to find pyroCb clouds in over 400 TB of data from the Himawari-8 and GOES-17 geostationary satellites by using only a few hundred labeled examples.
- Impact: Using our new catalog, we have been digging into the major factors that predict if a wildfire will develop into a pyroCb event and how we might mitigate them in the future.

### AI Researcher - Frontier Development Lab (remote): Jun 2021 -- Aug 2021
- Collaborated with a four-person team to speed up flood predictions by building a machine learning surrogate model for established inundation height model like NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean).
- We were the first to apply the physics-informed state-of-the-art Fourier Neural Operator models to a real-world setting and predicted inundation height better than the physical and ML baselines.
- Impact: Our work is a step in the direction of making practical, high-precision flooding predictions a possibility, which would inform evacuation orders and save lives.
